	integer or floating point number of seconds, indicating how long to wait for a result. Correct operation requires
	a modern MongoDB installation, version 3.2 or newer, and the client driver to support it.

	the timeout is used as the longest period of time to wait for a new record, resetting on each retrieved record.

	with an empty or otherwise unimportant record before attempting to use this feature.
